### ssh log-in attempts ###

[0] Pre-Install

 In this main folder there are 2 folders namely alphaserver as "master" and alphaclient as "node".

 Inside the "master", support tools such as redis and flask will be installed automatically through the shell script.

 Inside the "node", support tools such as filebeat will be installed automatically through the shell script.

 Before you start, you need to install to each master and nodes:

	- screen
	- python
	- pip
	- make

 * We assume that all SSH ports on master and nodes are port 22
 * All users used for installation on each master and node are root users
 * Internet network at each master and node is running well. Because there are several packages that will be downloaded from the official (filebeat and redis)

[1] Manual Install

[1.1] Install Master

~$ ssh root@[IP_MASTER]
~$ cd alphaserver
~$ ./setup.sh [REDIS_PASSWORD]

 if successful, you will see a message like this :

	[ APP running at http://[IP_MASTER]:5555 ]

[1.2] Install Node

 ~$ ssh root@[IP_NODE]
 ~$ cd alphaclient
 ~$ ./setup.sh [IP_MASTER] [REDIS_PASSWORD]

 if successful, you will see a message like this :

	[ Filebeat running as well ]

 if you have multiple nodes, repeat step [1.2] with a different IP_NODE

[2] Auto Install

 In this main folder there is a shell script with the name "setup".

 The default redis password is 'devops'. You can change it in the "setup" file on the 'redis_pass' variable

 Usage :

	~$ ./setup -m [IP_MASTER] -n [IP_NODE_1,IP_NODE_2,IP_NODE_N] -t [TYPE]

 Example :

	for high automation, make sure your host can do SSH without a password to the master and nodes

	## check master and nodes can log in without a password
	~$ ./setup -m xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -n yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy,zzz.zzz.zzz.zzz -t check

	## install master and node
	~$ ./setup -m xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -n yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy,zzz.zzz.zzz.zzz -t install

	## uninstall master and node
	~$ ./setup -m xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -n yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy,zzz.zzz.zzz.zzz -t uninstall

 You can see the APP at http://[IP_MASTER]:5555

 [3] What I did

   1. specifies a pattern for failed SSH log-in attempts from /var/log/auth.log. attempt failed when log-in failed in 1 session.

      the pattern is : ['Connection closed by authenticating user','Connection closed by invalid user']

   2. collect log metrics using filebeat and send them to redis
	
   3. the "master" APP will take the metrics from the redis and process it

   4. then the results of the processing will be displayed to HTTP
